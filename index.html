<h1>Welcome</h1>

Everything R related. Here I share my snippets and tips, tutorials and presentations that I've created while trying to master R. 
<br><br>
This site will function as my own external memory, and maybe you'll find it useful too. 
<br><br>
In the section <a href="/snippets-and-tips/">Snippets and tips</a> I've put all kinds of tidbits I've stumbled across, and might need as a memory back up. The [Tutorials](/tutorials/) section elaborates on some applications of R. Whenever statistical methods or algorithms are explained, I'll be explaining the concepts and how to achieve them in R, trying to avoid the bare-metal statistical formula's as much as possible: you learn to drive a car without knowing what a spark plug is, but you do need to know what the steer, gas and brake pedal does. The [Presentations](/presentations/) section contains some of the presentations I gave to people at work on the subject. 

<br><br>
Have fun R-ing!
